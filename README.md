# Weather_App

A simple weather dashboard created using react and tailwind. This app uses open weather API to retrieve the current weather in any major city in the world. 


# Inspiration

I wanted to polish up on my API skills and the most simple and entertaining project to practice those skills is creating a weather app. 

I always wanted to improve on my react skills while also learning a new framework in tailwind. This is my first project using Tailwind and i look forward to improving these skills on my next passion project.

# Usage

    <p>Notice that the background color is different in the two screenshots <br> This happens based off temperatures. Currently, when the temperature is ABOVE 60° the background color will be orange. When temperature is BELOW 60° the background changes to blue</p>
